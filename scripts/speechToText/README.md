# Speech-to-Text (STT) Application using Python and Vosk

This Python script processes audio input from a microphone and displays the transcribed text in real-time using the Vosk speech recognition library. It also includes a simple graphical user interface (GUI) created with tkinter for starting and stopping the recording process.

## Prerequisites

Before running the script, make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3
- sounddevice
- vosk
- tkinter (for the GUI)

You can install the required packages using pip:

```bash
pip install sounddevice vosk tkinter
